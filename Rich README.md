****AI_Powered_EDA_Sales_Data_Insights (Co-pilot -Driven)**

**An AI-powered sales analysis project built during vibe coding week using Github Copilot,Natural language prompts, and VS Code.

This project was developed using Github Copilot inside VS code with natural language prompts to accelerate data analysis,
Visualization, and forecasting.

Github Copilot interpreted these prompts into python code instantly,saving time and helping prototype business insights rapidly.

This project is a sales trend analysis and forecasting tool built using python,jupyter notebooks, and Github Copilot inside VS Code.**

Prompt Examples for GitHub Copilot

Below are the natural language instructions used with GitHub Copilot during this project:

---### üîç Data Analysis Prompts:
- "Load sales_data.csv using pandas"
- "Display basic statistics for the dataset"
- "Check for missing values and drop nulls"

### üìä Visualization Prompts:
- "Create line plot for monthly sales using matplotlib"
- "Plot bar chart for category-wise sales"
- "Show correlation heatmap using seaborn"

### üìà Forecasting Prompts:
- "Use linear regression to forecast next 6 months of sales"
- "Train-test split the dataset"
- "Plot actual vs predicted values"

### üõ† Automation Prompts:
- "Export plots to PNG"
- "Convert notebook into Python script"
- "List all required libraries in requirements.txt"

These prompts were typed as comments or docstring inside VS code, allowing Copilot to generate efficient and accurate code blocks instantly.
